			<p>Hello there, I&rsquo;m <a href="/img/Peter_Finnerty_Portrait.jpg">Peter Finnerty</a>. Check out my <a href="/pdf/Peter_Finnerty_CV.pdf">CV</a> and <a href="/pdf/Recommendation_Guyon.pdf">letters of recommendation</a>!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a recent graduate of LSE&rsquo;s MSc programme in Development Studies. I&rsquo;ve spent the past year studying financial technology in devleoping countries, with specific emphasis on user experience with digital credit applications. I&rsquo;m currently looking for a role in product analytics for a startup where I can dig into data to improve user experience.</p>

<p>I previously worked at Citigroup as an analyst with ICG Analytics, a statistical consulting division of the Investment and Corporate Banks. I worked on visualizations and reporting, which typically were used in C-suite presentations and <a href="https://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/investor-day/2017/data/p_institutional_clients_group170725.pdf">investor days</a>. While there, I taught R to a team of 15 and programmed tools to automate revenue reporting for teams in New York and London.</p>

<p>Prior to LSE and Citi, I was a student at Boston College. There, I studied Finance, Information Systems, and Sociology. I combined these interests in a critique published in Social Eyes, which you can see <a href="https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/sociology/pdf/socialeyes7.pdf#page=41">here</a>. I was on <a href="https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/offices/mission-ministry/sites/campus-ministry/service/4boston.html#join">4Boston</a> council, leading weekly volunteering at <a href="https://womenslunchplace.org/">Women&rsquo;s Lunch Place</a>.</p>

<p>For fun, I love to <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/18760479">run</a>, <a href="/img/Kilimanjaro.jpg">hike</a>, and listen to podcasts. I&rsquo;ve spent countless hours fly fishing and am obsessed with documentaries. I&rsquo;m currently reading Love in the Time of Cholera and Algorthims to Live By.</p>
